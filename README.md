# Ophthalmology-Measurements-UlcerSegmentations
The results from my practical course with CustomSurgical. 
In this course, I explored the possibility of creating a measurement tool for ophthalmology.
The tools created here include: 

# Slit Calibration
A script that segments a slit of light from the slit beam to determine the mm:pixel required for future measurements.

# Ulcer Segmentation Netwrok
To be uploaded soon.

# Measurement Tool and Metrics
A python script with functions that provide automated metrics based on the geometry of ulcer label maps or segmented masks from the Ulcer Segmentation Netwrok.
